Kilkakon's notes:

1.0.21.1 hotfix:
- The Theme Editor now displays using the appropriate DPI scaling
- The font size editor and the reset to default button will operate under the effective font size after scaling
- The Toggleable flag now works

1.0.21:
- Added Opacity slider in Settings to allow for semi transparent shimeji
- Added Theme tab in Settings to allow for theme editing without having to resort to trial and error
- Added the ability to set an optional background image for Window Mode, as well as different ways to size the image to fit
- Added the ability to enable or disable behaviours by right-clicking a shimeji, provided the `Toggleable` flag has been set to true on the relevant behaviour
- Added a new configuration file, info.xml
	This also allows setting a custom name and icon in the shimeji chooser
	Also supports displaying a splash screen the first time a shimeji is loaded, along with credits and links
	Clear the `InformationDismissed` setting from settings.properties if you want the splash screen to be seen again
- Exposed more variables that are now available for conditions
	Jump
	- TargetX and TargetY
	- VelocityX and VelocityY

	Fall
	- VelocityX and VelocityY

	ScanMove
	- Target

	ScanJump
	- Target
	- VelocityX and VelocityY
- Added new action type: ScanInteract
	Allows for long range interactions, optionally causing the target to react
	Supports the new `TargetLook` and `IsTurn` attributes as described below
- Added the `TargetLook` attribute to ScanMove and ScanJump, if set to true the target shimeji will face the scanner
- Added the `Toggleable` flag to behaviours, which allows users to enable or disable the behaviour from running at their leisure
- Added the ability for all actions to broadcast an Affordance, other than Dragged, Regist and the Scan variants
- Deprecated Broadcast, BroadcastJump, BroadcastMove and BroadcastStay. These actions will continue to work but there is now no difference between them and the normal variants
- Added the ability for Move, ScanMove and ScanInteract to have a turning animation that will be used automatically if the target is behind the shimeji. Use the new `IsTurn` attribute on the animation for this purpose
- Deprecated MoveWithTurn. This action will continue to function normally, assuming that the last animation is the IsTurn animation

1.0.20:
- Window Mode - run Shimeji in a Window! Ideal for streaming
- Added ScanJump and BroadcastJump actions
- "Boss mode" - double middle click on tray icon to quickly hide shimeji
- Incorporated snek's XML constant support (often used for cloning limit in japanese image sets)
- Allow hotspot with no behaviour set for click-hold style animations to work (e.g. now possible to make animated headpats)
- New Settings screen, along with new filtering and scaling options
- Reworked tray icon menu to include Shimeji Chooser and new Settings buttons
- Improved interactive window detection for greater accuracy and better Windows 11 support
- Better error messages for poses that don't have an image anchor
- Readdressed rare freezing issue when two shimeji play the same sound at exactly the same time
- Paused shimeji now can't be grabbed or have hotspots in a weird delayed fashion anymore
- General under the hood code cleanup
- Updates to Arabic, Catalan, French, Spanish and Polish translations (thank you!)

See https://youtu.be/paJLzf4hxnM for details

1.0.19:
- Hotspots! XML defined areas that will go to specified behaviours instead of the usual drag.
- The ability to pause and resume a shimeji's animations has been added
- Shimeji works again on Japanese locale computers
- Letting go of a shimeji no longer forces the shimeji to change to the landing animation when it's no longer appropriate to do so (for example, a shimeji that has resisted and broken free)
- Some code cleanup
- New translations: Arabic by Anas-dev, Traditional Chinese by Snowcat (thank you!)
- Updates to Catalan, French, Japanese, Spanish and Polish translations (thank you!)

See https://youtu.be/be7t4aI7xCE for details

1.0.18:
- BreedJump and BreedMove actions to allow Shimeji to clone while on the move.
- Exposed velocity during Fall to xml files so artists can create dynamic falling actions.
- Transient flag on breeding actions to categorise clones as normal or as a transient. I define transients as temporary shimeji like projectiles or other effects.
- Added Transients to Allowed Behaviours menu. 
- Fixed issue with Dragged OffsetX/Y that was preventing swing animations from playing.
- Fixed issue with interactive windows not working on Windows 7.
- Restored error message for icon.png being missing, made it non-fatal as per a suggestion from snek (thank you!)
- Some code cleanup
- Cassyz's updated French translation (thank you!)

1.0.17:

- The shimeji chooser can now be made to appear each time Shimeji is run.
- Changes made in the Shimeji chooser will not force still selected Shimeji to be reloaded.
- Unused shimeji chooser check is now case-insensitive, and also skips any folder starting with .
- Invisible window glitch fixed. I admit this was a very difficult one to crack! On Windows 10, Metro apps that are closed or minimised would still be reported as visible by the operating system. I was able to come up with a solution, and now everything works, although it will mean that the minimum version of Windows supported is now Vista.
- When "Move Between Screens" is off, Shimeji will be slightly better behaved in staying on the same screen (will not consider windows on another screen as valid interactive windows).
- When "Move Between Screens" is off, Shimeji will no longer spawn on other monitors when initially spawning, or when running out of valid actions.
- Restore Windows now actually works.
- "Dismiss All Others" added to right-click menu. Dismisses shimejis of all types other than the one clicked
- The Dragged action now has two new properties, OffsetX (default 0) and OffsetY (default 120). This allows an artist to change where the shimeji holds onto the mouse cursor!
- Critical security fix. I can go into it more detail in private if you wish, part of me feels it might be best not to make the news too public.

1.0.5:

I did some basic changes to the program to make this new version. I did make an effort to contact
the original group but they didn't reply--so I'm releasing this as is, with full credit to them. :)

So cheers shimeji-ee group!

I may have accidentally pressed Alt+Shift+F in Netbeans in a few of the files because I can't stand 
if (...) { style brackets. Sorry if that offends anybody. :O

The main changes I made in this version:

- settings.properties instead of windows.txt and ActiveShimeji
- New form and renamed captions and reworked menus
- Not showing form on load
