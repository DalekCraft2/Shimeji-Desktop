Kilkakon's notes:

1.0.19:
- Hotspots! XML defined areas that will go to specified behaviours instead of the usual drag.
- The ability to pause and resume a shimeji's animations has been added
- Shimeji works again on Japanese locale computers
- Letting go of a shimeji no longer forces the shimeji to change to the landing animation when it's no longer appropriate to do so (for example, a shimeji that has resisted and broken free)
- Some code cleanup
- New translations: Arabic by Anas-dev, Traditional Chinese by Snowcat (thank you!)
- Updates to Catalan, French, Japanese, Spanish and Polish translations (thank you!)

See https://youtu.be/be7t4aI7xCE for details

1.0.18:
- BreedJump and BreedMove actions to allow Shimeji to clone while on the move.
- Exposed velocity during Fall to xml files so artists can create dynamic falling actions.
- Transient flag on breeding actions to categorise clones as normal or as a transient. I define transients as temporary shimeji like projectiles or other effects.
- Added Transients to Allowed Behaviours menu. 
- Fixed issue with Dragged OffsetX/Y that was preventing swing animations from playing.
- Fixed issue with interactive windows not working on Windows 7.
- Restored error message for icon.png being missing, made it non-fatal as per a suggestion from snek (thank you!)
- Some code cleanup
- Cassyz's updated French translation (thank you!)

1.0.17:

- The shimeji chooser can now be made to appear each time Shimeji is run.
- Changes made in the Shimeji chooser will not force still selected Shimeji to be reloaded.
- Unused shimeji chooser check is now case insensitive, and also skips any folder starting with .
- Invisible window glitch fixed. I admit this was a very difficult one to crack! On Windows 10, Metro apps that are closed or minimised would still be reported as visible by the operating system. I was able to come up with a solution, and now everything works, although it will mean that the minimum version of Windows supported is now Vista.
- When "Move Between Screens" is off, Shimeji will be slightly better behaved in staying on the same screen (will not consider windows on another screen as valid interactive windows).
- When "Move Between Screens" is off, Shimeji will no longer spawn on other monitors when initially spawning, or when running out of valid actions.
- Restore Windows now actually works.
- "Dismiss All Others" added to right-click menu. Dismisses shimejis of all types other than the one clicked
- The Dragged action now has two new properties, OffsetX (default 0) and OffsetY (default 120). This allows an artist to change where the shimeji holds onto the mouse cursor!
- Critical security fix. I can go into it more detail in private if you wish, part of me feels it might be best not to make the news too public.

- "Transformation" behaviour toggle to stop Shimeji transforming
- hqx scaling filter for scaling factors above 1, using Edu Garcia's version: https://github.com/Arcnor/hqx-java
- Generic sound folder to allow different Shimeji to share the same sound files
- Count variable exposed to xml conditions (number of shimeji of the current type as opposed to all types)
- Muting action (stop a specific or all sounds)
- Windows Lockscreen freezing shimeji bug fix
- Plugging in another screen freezing shimeji bug fix

Added premultiplying to the images so translucent images work now, yay!

1.0.5:

I did some basic changes to the program to make this new version. I did make an effort to contact
the original group but they didn't reply--so I'm releasing this as is, with full credit to them. :)

So cheers shimeji-ee group!

I may have accidentally pressed Alt+Shift+F in Netbeans in a few of the files because I can't stand 
if (...) { style brackets. Sorry if that offends anybody. :O

The main changes I made in this version:

- settings.properties instead of windows.txt and ActiveShimeji
- New form and renamed captions and reworked menus
- Not showing form on load
