Kilkakon's notes:

1.0.22:
- Added shimeji Variables. Use in conditions with the `mascot.variables[ 'example' ]` syntax to restore variables that will persist for the lifetime of the individual shimeji
- Added the Interactive Window blacklist, which allows users to specify windows that will not be interactive, regardless of what is set in the Interactive Windows list. If only the blacklist is in use, then all windows not caught by the list will be interactive
- Added `ShimejiEENameOverride` to settings.properties. When set the given string will be used for the menu caption and system tray tooltip, instead of what's set in language.properties
- Added OffsetType to the Dragged action. Valid options are `ImageAnchor` (the default, which starts from the ImageAnchor, with positive values going up and left) or `Origin` (which starts from the origin of the image, with positive values going right and down)
- Added OffsetX, OffsetY and OffsetType to the Regist [sic] action, which operate in the same way as Dragged
- Added descriptive help text to the Theme Editor in Settings
- Enabled the colour text fields in the Theme Editor and Window Mode tabs in Settings for direct input
- Removed Primary 3 from the Theme Editor as Shimeji-ee does not use this colour
- Fixed ScanInteract, Interact and Transformation from not firing when they had a duration of 1
- Fixed Dragged randomly failing and causing the Shimeji to respawn from the top of the screen
- Rewrote file loading so Shimeji-ee can find image files on Japanese computers
- Shimeji Chooser will now automatically appear if no shimeji were successfully loaded, to avoid users having to manually correct settings.properties when shimeji folders are swapped out. The Chooser will continue to reappear until a shimeji loads successfully or the user closes it
- Shimeji Chooser now displays shimeji names in bold and uses theme colours for the list and clickable labels
- Shimeji Chooser and Settings screens will pause shimeji while open (to prevent softlocks when they are thrown off screen)
- Shimeji Chooser and Information screens will now use the shimeji tray icon
- Pause Animations button will now pause shimeji if any are unpaused, only changing to Resume Animations if all shimeji are paused
- Added detailed information to error messages to assist in user debugging
- Code cleanup: Fixed under the hood null exception when cancelling the Interactive Window prompt
- Updates to Arabic, Catalan, French, Polish and Spanish translations (thank you!)

See https://youtu.be/CV46UPIDdYM for more details

1.0.21.3:
- Added ComplexJump and ComplexMove. Uses the `Characteristics` attribute to determine which logic is enabled, as a comma separated list (e.g. "Breed,Scan"). Currently supports Breed and Scan characteristics
- Added the TargetX and TargetY variables to Scanning actions for scripts to use instead, can be null if no target is available
- Removed the target variable from Scanning actions, as it had unfortunate under the hood implications
- Dismissed shimeji no longer Broadcast Affordances
- Information screen text now uses theme colours instead of a hardcoded black and blue
- Information screen now centred correctly when opened
- Information screen now centres the internal image when a small one is used
- Closing the information screen using the X no longer closes Shimeji
- Fixed Conditions being ignored on Move ActionReferences
- General under the hood code cleanup, particularly regarding Breed and Move actions
- Updates to Chinese translation (thank you!)

1.0.21.2:
- Added the BornCount parameter, to allow multiple shimeji to be spawned at once.
- Low velocities can no longer be reduced to 0 when at scale 0.5.

1.0.21.1 hotfix:
- The Theme Editor now displays using the appropriate DPI scaling
- The font size editor and the reset to default button will operate under the effective font size after scaling
- The Toggleable flag now works

1.0.21:
- Added Opacity slider in Settings to allow for semi transparent shimeji
- Added Theme tab in Settings to allow for theme editing without having to resort to trial and error
- Added the ability to set an optional background image for Window Mode, as well as different ways to size the image to fit
- Added the ability to enable or disable behaviours by right-clicking a shimeji, provided the `Toggleable` flag has been set to true on the relevant behaviour
- Added a new configuration file, info.xml
	This also allows setting a custom name and icon in the shimeji chooser
	Also supports displaying a splash screen the first time a shimeji is loaded, along with credits and links
	Clear the `InformationDismissed` setting from settings.properties if you want the splash screen to be seen again
- Exposed more variables that are now available for conditions
	Jump
	- TargetX and TargetY
	- VelocityX and VelocityY

	Fall
	- VelocityX and VelocityY

	ScanMove
	- Target

	ScanJump
	- Target
	- VelocityX and VelocityY
- Added new action type: ScanInteract
	Allows for long range interactions, optionally causing the target to react
	Supports the new `TargetLook` and `IsTurn` attributes as described below
- Added the `TargetLook` attribute to ScanMove and ScanJump, if set to true the target shimeji will face the scanner
- Added the `Toggleable` flag to behaviours, which allows users to enable or disable the behaviour from running at their leisure
- Added the ability for all actions to broadcast an Affordance, other than Dragged, Regist and the Scan variants
- Deprecated Broadcast, BroadcastJump, BroadcastMove and BroadcastStay. These actions will continue to work but there is now no difference between them and the normal variants
- Added the ability for Move, ScanMove and ScanInteract to have a turning animation that will be used automatically if the target is behind the shimeji. Use the new `IsTurn` attribute on the animation for this purpose
- Deprecated MoveWithTurn. This action will continue to function normally, assuming that the last animation is the IsTurn animation

1.0.20:
- Window Mode - run Shimeji in a Window! Ideal for streaming
- Added ScanJump and BroadcastJump actions
- "Boss mode" - double middle click on tray icon to quickly hide shimeji
- Incorporated snek's XML constant support (often used for cloning limit in japanese image sets)
- Allow hotspot with no behaviour set for click-hold style animations to work (e.g. now possible to make animated headpats)
- New Settings screen, along with new filtering and scaling options
- Reworked tray icon menu to include Shimeji Chooser and new Settings buttons
- Improved interactive window detection for greater accuracy and better Windows 11 support
- Better error messages for poses that don't have an image anchor
- Readdressed rare freezing issue when two shimeji play the same sound at exactly the same time
- Paused shimeji now can't be grabbed or have hotspots in a weird delayed fashion anymore
- General under the hood code cleanup
- Updates to Arabic, Catalan, French, Spanish and Polish translations (thank you!)

See https://youtu.be/paJLzf4hxnM for details

1.0.19:
- Hotspots! XML defined areas that will go to specified behaviours instead of the usual drag.
- The ability to pause and resume a shimeji's animations has been added
- Shimeji works again on Japanese locale computers
- Letting go of a shimeji no longer forces the shimeji to change to the landing animation when it's no longer appropriate to do so (for example, a shimeji that has resisted and broken free)
- Some code cleanup
- New translations: Arabic by Anas-dev, Traditional Chinese by Snowcat (thank you!)
- Updates to Catalan, French, Japanese, Spanish and Polish translations (thank you!)

See https://youtu.be/be7t4aI7xCE for details

1.0.18:
- BreedJump and BreedMove actions to allow Shimeji to clone while on the move.
- Exposed velocity during Fall to xml files so artists can create dynamic falling actions.
- Transient flag on breeding actions to categorise clones as normal or as a transient. I define transients as temporary shimeji like projectiles or other effects.
- Added Transients to Allowed Behaviours menu. 
- Fixed issue with Dragged OffsetX/Y that was preventing swing animations from playing.
- Fixed issue with interactive windows not working on Windows 7.
- Restored error message for icon.png being missing, made it non-fatal as per a suggestion from snek (thank you!)
- Some code cleanup
- Cassyz's updated French translation (thank you!)

1.0.17:

- The shimeji chooser can now be made to appear each time Shimeji is run.
- Changes made in the Shimeji chooser will not force still selected Shimeji to be reloaded.
- Unused shimeji chooser check is now case-insensitive, and also skips any folder starting with .
- Invisible window glitch fixed. I admit this was a very difficult one to crack! On Windows 10, Metro apps that are closed or minimised would still be reported as visible by the operating system. I was able to come up with a solution, and now everything works, although it will mean that the minimum version of Windows supported is now Vista.
- When "Move Between Screens" is off, Shimeji will be slightly better behaved in staying on the same screen (will not consider windows on another screen as valid interactive windows).
- When "Move Between Screens" is off, Shimeji will no longer spawn on other monitors when initially spawning, or when running out of valid actions.
- Restore Windows now actually works.
- "Dismiss All Others" added to right-click menu. Dismisses shimejis of all types other than the one clicked
- The Dragged action now has two new properties, OffsetX (default 0) and OffsetY (default 120). This allows an artist to change where the shimeji holds onto the mouse cursor!
- Critical security fix. I can go into it more detail in private if you wish, part of me feels it might be best not to make the news too public.

1.0.5:

I did some basic changes to the program to make this new version. I did make an effort to contact
the original group but they didn't reply--so I'm releasing this as is, with full credit to them. :)

So cheers shimeji-ee group!

I may have accidentally pressed Alt+Shift+F in Netbeans in a few of the files because I can't stand 
if (...) { style brackets. Sorry if that offends anybody. :O

The main changes I made in this version:

- settings.properties instead of windows.txt and ActiveShimeji
- New form and renamed captions and reworked menus
- Not showing form on load
